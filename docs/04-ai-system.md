# DegreeWiki AI System

## Purpose

This file defines how DegreeWiki uses AI in the product and in development.

## Core AI Product Principle

DegreeWiki is not AI-first. DegreeWiki is database-first and AI-assisted.

AI should explain, summarize, classify, and guide.

AI must not invent factual education data.

## AI Finder Rule

Correct AI Finder flow:

1. Student completes profile.
2. System filters real programs from DegreeWiki database.
3. Rule-based scoring ranks programs.
4. System creates program shortlist.
5. AI explains why the shortlisted programs may fit.
6. AI provides warnings and next steps.

The LLM must not independently invent recommended programs.

## AI Chatbot Rule

The chatbot should answer from DegreeWiki context first.

Preferred order:

1. Static/rule-based response
2. Structured database query
3. Existing articles/guides
4. RAG/vector search later
5. LLM explanation
6. Fallback/clarification

## AI Orchestration Pipeline

For each user message:

1. Normalize message.
2. Detect intent.
3. Extract entities:
   - country
   - subject
   - degree level
   - university
   - budget
   - deadline
   - scholarship
4. Check rate limit.
5. Route request.
6. Retrieve relevant DegreeWiki data.
7. Build safe context.
8. Call LLM only if needed.
9. Save message, retrieved context, model usage.
10. Return answer.

## Common Intents

- greeting
- program_search
- university_search
- scholarship_search
- country_info
- subject_info
- eligibility_check
- program_comparison
- cost_question
- deadline_question
- visa_general_info
- application_roadmap
- finder_followup
- general_study_abroad

## Safe Scope

The chatbot can help with:

- program discovery
- country comparison
- scholarship guidance
- admission requirement explanation
- deadline/intake explanation
- document checklist
- profile-based fit explanation
- study-abroad planning

The chatbot must avoid:

- guaranteed admission claims
- guaranteed scholarship claims
- visa approval predictions
- fake document advice
- fraud
- plagiarism
- legal/immigration guarantees
- financial advice outside study planning

## Safe Wording

Use:

"Based on available DegreeWiki data..."

"This appears to be a stronger fit..."

"Please confirm final details on the official university or scholarship website."

Do not use:

"You will be accepted."

"You are eligible for sure."

"This visa will be approved."

## LLM Provider Strategy

Use AI Gateway abstraction.

Initial provider:

- Gemini

Future providers:

- OpenRouter
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- OpenAI
- other low-cost models

Do not hardcode product logic to one LLM provider.

## Suggested AI Code Structure

src/lib/ai/
  gateway.ts
  providers/
    gemini.ts
    openrouter.ts
  routing/
    intent-router.ts
    rules.ts
  prompts/
    finder-summary.ts
    chat-answer.ts
  safety/
    guardrails.ts
  usage/
    limits.ts
    logging.ts

## RAG Strategy

MVP:

- structured database queries
- direct context from selected records
- simple FAQ/template responses

MVP-plus:

- ai_search_text fields
- embeddings for programs/articles/scholarships
- Supabase pgvector

Later:

- content_chunks
- vector search
- citations
- retrieved context tracking

Do not start with ChromaDB unless Supabase pgvector is not enough.

## AI Usage Limits

Anonymous users:

- very limited daily AI usage
- temporary profile/results
- expiry cleanup

Logged-in users:

- higher daily usage
- saved profiles/results
- saved conversations

Paid users later:

- higher usage
- deeper recommendations
- more conversations

## AI Development Workflow

For AI coding tools:

1. Ask for plan only.
2. Review plan with ChatGPT.
3. Approve or revise.
4. Let AI implement.
5. Ask for summary.
6. Review summary with ChatGPT.
7. Fix issues.
8. Update docs/06-status.md.
9. Append to docs/07-task-log.md.

Coding agents should not silently change architecture.
