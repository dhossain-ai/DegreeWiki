# DegreeWiki Current Status

> AI agent reading rule:
> Read this active status file first for current context. Open archive files only when older phase detail is specifically needed, and pick the smallest matching archive range.

## Current Project Status

Phase 68 is complete. The import pipeline is in a stable polish state, and the next focus is Phase 69A - AI Provider Routing Inspection Only.

Current branch: `main`

Very short import pipeline summary:
- Program Import Staging is the primary path.
- General Batch Creation stays Advanced / Legacy.
- Review rows first, then choose the production action, then publish only if needed.
- Cleanup is super-admin only and limited to import/staging records.

## Current Import Workflows

- First import: approve -> merge new programs -> publish as unverified.
- Enrichment: approve -> update existing matched programs.
- Approved rows remain the only rows eligible for production actions.
- Batch actions stay scoped to visible or explicitly matched rows unless a deliberate all-matching confirmation is used.

## Critical Rules

- No source code, migration, or package changes for this docs-only cleanup.
- No service role, `createServiceClient`, or RLS bypass in app pages.
- No production deletion from import cleanup: programs, universities, scholarships, articles, media, and production `data_sources` stay untouched.
- No auto-overwrite of non-empty production fields.
- No subject auto-creation and no intake/deadline import.
- No unsafe HTML APIs such as `set:html` or `innerHTML`.

## Known Open Notes

- Cloudinary still needs the SHA-256 signature setup, or `CLOUDINARY_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM=sha1` as a fallback.
- Default site OG image is still not configured.
- CSV import and persistent uploaded-file import storage remain deferred.
- Country/city/subject detail pages beyond the current destination listing remain deferred.
- `program_intakes` import remains intentionally deferred.

## Reading Guidance

- Future agents should read archive files only when older context is specifically needed.
- Use the narrowest matching phase range first.
- Prefer the recent task log for current work, and the split archives for older phase details.
